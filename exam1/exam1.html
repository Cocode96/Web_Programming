		<h1>PUBLISHING@W3C</h1>
		<h2> HTML </h2>
		<p>The web was cre­ated to pro­vide ac­cess to a “uni­verse of doc­u­ments.” Since then, the Web has be­come many things, but doc­u­ments and, by ex­ten­sion, pub­li­ca­tions, have re­mained close to the heart of the Web.</p>

		<p>Many pub­lish­ers use EPUB to bring dig­i­tal con­tent to their read­ers. EPUB is built from Web tech­nolo­gies, but pub­lish­ing uses the web for so much more, from every­day mat­ters of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and mar­ket­ing to learn­ing man­age­ment sys­tems and on­line jour­nals. Print and dig­i­tal books are bought and sold on web­sites.

		But pub­li­ca­tions are still not first-class cit­i­zens of the web. EPUB ex­ists in silos, some­what dis­con­nected from the web.</p><p> Long texts make spe­cial de­mands on read­ers. We ex­pect to read books and pub­li­ca­tions even while of­fline. We hope to share pub­li­ca­tions, save them, keep them. We ex­pect a kind of per­ma­nence to pub­li­ca­tions, which we don’t typ­i­cally ex­pect of web sites.</p>
